A description of the problem and a discussion of the background\n\n1.1 Background\n\nDallas is the third largest city in Texas, with 1.33 million residents as of 2019. The two larger cities, Houston and San Antonio have a well-established demographic of Chinese and Asian restaurants. Most large cities have authentic Japanese and Korean restaurants, in addition to Asian fusion restaurants. However, there aren\u2019t a significant number of Chinese restaurants that specialize in authentic Chinese food.\n\n1.2 Business Problem\n\nWe are looking for a location in the city of Dallas to open a Chinese restaurant. The study must include data on the all dining facilities, including how they are distributed in the city and their disposition. The opening of the new restaurants requires this study to decide the preferred location to guarantee the best foundation for the restaurant.\n\n1.3 Stakeholders\n\nThis project would be of interest to entrepreneurs who wish to open a Chinese restaurant in Dallas, TX or potentially if someone would like to open a restaurant of any type. This project will provide data analytics for the restaurants and diners places found on Foursquare in the Toronto Area.\n\n\n### 2.
